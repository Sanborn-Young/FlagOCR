# FlagOCR
Select your subdirectory and if your PDF has an OCR layer it will rename it as _OCR

#### This is very dirty, as I have a shoulder separation and I can't type. This is a quick upload basically done with my left hand.

Look for the file that says Flag OCR.exe in the list of files. Click on this name, and you will see a small download arrow which will allow you to download the file. Classically dot exe files will give you a warning as they are not signed. So when Windows gives you a window defender warning, you simply click that you would like to keep and then you're smart and run the file anyway. Alternatively I've included the Python script, which you can run from a python interpreter. I tested it with 10.5, which is my classic virtual environment.
